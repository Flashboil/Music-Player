# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program was developed in CLion, a C and C++ editor from JetBrains.com.

The program is written entirely in C++.
Filesystem library is used to work with directories and files.

# AI Disclosure

I used ChatGPT as a learning tool throughout this project's development. I used it particularly to help understand the 
documentation for filesystem and how to use certain functions of the library. I also used it to help understand debugging messages.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Music player functionality. Currently, the program only scans for mp3s and 
  extracts relevant metadata without actually playing the tracks found.
